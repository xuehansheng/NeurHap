## Overview

</p>

Haplotype phasing is formulated as a graph coloring problem by constructing the Read-overlap graph. NeurHap consists of ***NeurHap***-search, a graph neural network to learn vertex representations and color assignments, and ***NeurHap***-refine, a local refinement strategy to further adjust colors.
